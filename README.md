# RWAV Bridge (Beta)

RWAV Bridge is a tiny companion app that lets RWAV talk to your Roon Core. Install it on a computer (or server/NAS) that can reach your Core. Once running, RWAV MCP will find it automatically.

## Quick Start

1) Download the latest RWAV Bridge for your OS from Releases.
2) Run it and leave it running while you use RWAV.
3) Open your MCP client and start using RWAV tools — the connection happens automatically. If MCP can’t find the Bridge, it will show you how to fix it.

## What You Need

- A Roon Core on your network
- This Bridge app running on the same network

## Privacy

The Bridge keeps control on your local network. No cloud is required.

## Help

If you need a hand, open an issue in this repo. We’ll keep the docs simple and user‑friendly during beta.
